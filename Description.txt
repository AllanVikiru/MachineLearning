Methods of Transforming Data

Nominal - One Hot Encoding 
e.g.    Karen = 10000,
	Buruburu = 01000,
	Madaraka = 00100,
	Langata = 00010
	
     

Ordinal - Integer Encoding 
e.g.    Serene = 3, 
	Semi-serene = 2, 
	Noisy = 1

Categorical data - Nominal and Ordinal
Ratio and Interval stay the same cause they're numeric.
Collinearity: one feature may affect the outcome of the other e.g. proximity to a school may affect ambience (noise)
